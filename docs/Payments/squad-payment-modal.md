Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
import {x, y} as p from 'point';
const ANSWER = 42;

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(speed, cost) {
    super(speed);

    var c = Symbol('cost');
    this[c] = cost;

    this.intro = `This is a car runs at
      ${speed}.`;
  }
}

for (let num of [1, 2, 3]) {
  console.log(num + 0b111110111);
}

function $initHighlight(block, flags) {
  try {
    if (block.className.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return processBlock(block.function, true, 0x0F) + ' class=""';
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
    var e4x =
        <div>Example
            <p>1234</p></div>;
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) {
  // "0 / 2" should not be parsed as regexp
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      return /\d+[\s/]/g;
  }
  console.log(Array.every(classes, Boolean));
}

export  $initHighlight;

```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
